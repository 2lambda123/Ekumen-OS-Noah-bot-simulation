# noah_gazebo

Package containing the top level simulation launch files, worlds and models for the [AWS small_house world](https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-small-house-world).

The models should be placed inside the gazebo models folder usually located in `~/.gazebo/models/` for the world to correctly load.
